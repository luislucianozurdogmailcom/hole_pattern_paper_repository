This thermal system ([[Thermal systems or devices]]) could be analogous to a capacitor system in the presence of a potential [[@wehmeyerThermalDiodesRegulators2017]] [[@luoDeterminingThermalCapacitance2011]], where the amount of the incoming and out-coming heat flux ([[Heat flux]]) is proportional to the amount of energy stored and released by the domain.
The rectification ([[thermal rectification]]) ratio also indicate us a comparison of absorption and released energy by the domain in right and left sides, thus the system works like a capacitor with different capacitance according to the side ([[Assymetry]]) where is the temperature oscillation ([[Oscillating temperature]]). 
This effect not only depends on the location of the excitation but also strongly depends on the frequency and the geometry of the hole.
