# Rectification magnitud
The rectification is a transport phenomenon where because of some specific particularities of the system, the transported goods are more easily moved in one direction than in the other [[@lohThermalRectificationReversal2012]].

The change of some specific parameters do not change the rectification behavior, but already change his magnitud, like in the [[@zhangReversalThermalRectification2009]] where for different temperature differences in the heat baths of the system, alters the rectifications values.

1. **Rectification efficiency:** R=\fracc{J_{+}-J_{-}}{max(J_{+},J_{-})}
2. **Other definition**: R=\fracc{J_{+}-J_{-}}{J_{-}} [[@lohThermalRectificationReversal2012]]
3. **Absolute difference**: R=\fracc{|k_{f}-k_{r}|}{max(k_{f},k_{r})} [[@wongReviewStateArt2021]]
Used for calculating when the heat transfer is defined as fowrwar direction.
4. **Other definition**: R=\fracc{G_H-G_L}{G_L} G are the thermal conductances of the sample in the directions of higher and lower heat flows under the same temperature difference, respectively.
