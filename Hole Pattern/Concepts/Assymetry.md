# Assymetry
In many studies[[@zhangReversalThermalRectification2009]], it is search for a modificable aspect in the system in order to obtain rectification and make possible the control of the heat flux.

By make a nonuniform modification like adding assymetry in the system operation, rectification effect can be appreciate. For the other hand, when assymetry doesn't exist, a zero rectification is observed.
Adding more assymetry to the system, the greater [[Rectification magnitud]] will be as it is showed in [[@lohThermalRectificationReversal2012]], in contrast it is not the case of the size of the [[Anisotropy]] generating elements because in which the rectification ratio is not affected by his size.
