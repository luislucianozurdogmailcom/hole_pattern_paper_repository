# Holes geometry
The construction industry develop better insulation materials that improves the best use of energy and take care of the environment. To achieve this, [[@Al-Tamimi2017a]] designed holes arrangements with different cross section porcentaje of the material surface in order to reducing the thermal flow through it. 

These studies showed that not only increasing the cross-section led to better [[Thermal management]] of the system, but also made it possible to choose different shapes for the holes.
