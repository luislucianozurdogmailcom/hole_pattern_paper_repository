# Negative rectification
In some cases and for specific configurations of the external parameters that generates the system [[Assymetry]] , it is possible to see a negative rectification of the heat flux. In [[@zhangReversalThermalRectification2009]] explains that this effect do not occur in the electronic field. 

The [[Anisotropy]] properties of the system, can also produce a reversal rectification.
In [[@lohThermalRectificationReversal2012]] study, positive rectification is arbitrary defined when the greater flux J_{+} is flowin from left to right, and negative when J_{+} in the opposite direction. 

As shown is [[@zhangReversalThermalRectification2009]] and [[@lohThermalRectificationReversal2012]] the reversal in the thermal rectification can be procuct of the variation of the heat temprerature bath [[Oscillating temperature]].
