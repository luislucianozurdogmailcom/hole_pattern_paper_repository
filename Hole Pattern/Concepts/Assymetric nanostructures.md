# Assymetric nanostructures

By keeping our study dimensionless, it will be valid for millimeter, micro and nano scale devices. Studies such as  [[@Wang2017]] proposes that precence of nanoholes, nanoparticles deposition and thin film form modification (tapered width i.e.) to build  [[assymetry]] in a nanostructure device, as in the case of bulk materials, it can also generate a [[thermal rectification]] phenomenon.
