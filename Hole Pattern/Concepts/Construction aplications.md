# Construction Sector
The construction industrial sector [[Industrial aplications]] is very related to the thermal management ([[Thermal systems or devices]] [[Manipulation heat flux]] ) due to the climatic inclemency that building are submitted in extreme places [[Thermal agressive enviroments]]. Often the building must be optimized in thermal insulation for preserve the energy consumption as lower as possible, this is possible to achieve by through applications of hole patterns with different cross section sizes in the bricks used [[@cottrillPersistentEnergyHarvesting2019]]. It show that not only increasing the cross-section led to better thermal management of the system, but also made it possible to choose different shapes for the holes
