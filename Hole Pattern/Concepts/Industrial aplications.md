# Industrial Aplication

Military and space exploration vehicles are the first major applications that could significantly benefit from this technology. Control electronics and sensors of a jet or rocket engine that could be placed directly on or into the engine would be of great use.

Energy companies are interested in Sic power electronics. Deep Earth exploration encounters hostile environments and extreme temperatures in which it is difficult to place silicon electronics. With Sic, it is possible to send electronics down-hole, thereby improving motor drive control and efficiency, increasing exploration and sensors' capabilities, and ultimately aiding in the discovery of previously hidden energy sources.
