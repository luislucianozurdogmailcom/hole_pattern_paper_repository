# Thermal systems or devices
Along the time the electronic systems and devices, are in constant miniaturization due to the tecnological advances in that matter, this is descripted by moore's law [[Moore's Law]]. Then the thermal systems or devices has to achieve new orders of heat removal. This problem is realted with focals hot spots in the solid devices and with the geometry of the device.

The 55% of the failures in the electronic devices are caused by the failure of thermal management and furthermore this is be[[@heThermalManagementTemperature2021]] cause the non uniform distribution of the temperature on the chip surface .
