# Heat flux
Because of the fact that the rectification can be reversal [[Negative rectification]], It is convenient to define the heat flux not by his direction,becaus is not moving in a fixed direction, but for it's magnitud. In [[@lohThermalRectificationReversal2012]].

Because of the this, the greater heat flux can experience a reversal in their direction inside the system.
