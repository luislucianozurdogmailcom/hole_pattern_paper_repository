# Space thermal cycling
Taking the international space station condition as a reference of [[Space harsh environment]], the extreme temperature variotion that occurs outside the spacecraft are around $173K$ and then $373 K$ every $45 min$ in the transition procces of through from the earth's dark shadow to earth's sun lit side [[@cardinalettiOrganicPerovskiteSolar2018]], [[@Thirsk2009]].


In some experiments [[@gaoNovelLowColored2018]] that try to emulate the [[Oscillating temperature]] in space, the temperature range is between $156 K$ to $361 K$ inside a thermal chamber with a vaccum pressure.
