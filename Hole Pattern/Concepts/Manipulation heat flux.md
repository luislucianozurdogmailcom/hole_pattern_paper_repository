# Manipulation heat flux

The heat flux is a nature flux as electromagnetic flux. Be able to control it, it's important because we can develop multiple functions asociated with the refrigeration of the electronic devices [[Thermal systems or devices]].

We can use metamaterials to develop heat flux manipulation like invertion, shielding, contration and cloacking [[@fachinottiOptimizationbasedDesignEasytomake2018]]
