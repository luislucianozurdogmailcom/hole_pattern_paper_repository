abstract: In principle, rectifying phonon and electron flows appear similar, whereby more energy is transported in one direction than the opposite one. However, their physical mechanisms are inherently different. By using molecular dynamics simulations, this study reports on a few interesting aspects of thermal rectification in carbon nanotubes: (1) The dependence of the rectification ratio on the structural symmetry (represented by the position of vacancy clusters) of the nanotube and more importantly (2) a reversal in the rectifying direction as the normalized temperature difference of the heat baths is increased. The flux-mediated diffuse mismatch model is extended to explain the reversal phenomenon—initially with a simplifying assumption that the transmission coefficients at the vacancy/scatterer are identical in bidirectional phonon transport, and then with a moderating factor to distinguish between both coefficients. It is noted that in both cases, the conditions for thermal rectification reversal are attaina...

# Annotations:
1. *Rectiﬁcation is a transport phenomenon whereby the transfer of carriers in one particular direction is at a larger rate than that in the opposite direction.*
2. *It is noted that these deﬁnitions of J_{+} and J_{-}	 are different from those in other studies. In the latter, each of these ﬂuxes is taken to be in a certain direction, while J_{+} is still the larger ﬂux. On the other hand, this work examines the reversal of thermal rectiﬁcation, in which the larger ﬂux does not have a ﬁxed direction under different parameters. Therefore J_{+} and J_{-} are not deﬁned in directional terms, but rather distinguished by their magnitude.*
3. *The carbon nanotube becomes more asymmetric in its structure, it undergoes greater thermal rectiﬁcation.*
4. *This reversal of thermal rectiﬁcation, or a switch in direction of J_{+} and J_{-}, suggests that the rectifying direction is not absolute. The stronger thermal ﬂux can reverse its direction towards or away from the vacancy clusters.*
5. *With a constant cold bath temperature and a varying hot bath temperature T_{H}, the normalized temperature difference is changed. This is fundamentally analogous to pseudo-realistic situations whereby the heat production sites (hot end) in nanoelectronic devices have a non-constant temperature, while the base plate is the cold end of an inﬁnite heat sink.*
6. *Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the correlation between the position of vacancy defects (which deﬁnes the asymmetry of the structure) and the rectiﬁcation ratio, and dissociate the direct dependence of the rectiﬁcation ratio on the size of the defects. The reversal of rectifying direction is observed as the normalized tem- perature difference of the heat baths is varied.*
