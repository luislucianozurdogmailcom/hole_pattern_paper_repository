abstract: We study thermal transport in anisotropic Heisenberg spin chains using the quantum master equation. It is found that thermal rectification changes sign when the external homogeneous magnetic field is varied. This reversal also occurs when the magnetic field becomes inhomogeneous. Moreover, we can tune the reversal of rectification by temperatures of the heat baths, the anisotropy, and size of the spin chains.

# Annotations:
1. *Much work has also been done in quantum heat transport of nanostructures10 and spin systems where the magnetic ﬁeld is another degree of freedom to control heat ﬂow. Indeed, it is demonstrated that thermal rectiﬁcation and negative-differential thermal resistance are observable in quantum spin chain by applying a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld.*
2. *To quantify the rectification efficiency: R=(J+ - J_)/max{J+,J_}*
3. *The quantum spin chain is a nonlinear system; if we in- troduce asymmetry to the system then it may show the rectiﬁcation effect.*
4. *The rectiﬁcation is zero when the magnetic ﬁeld is zero because of no asymmetry in the system.*
5. *For different temperature difference, the rectiﬁca-tion has similar effect but different magnitude.*
6. *Rectiﬁcation can change sign with the external parameter, such as magnetic ﬁeld and the temperatures of the heat baths. In our study, we ﬁnd that thermal rectiﬁcation can reverse with the properties of the spin chain itself, such as the size and the anisotropy of the spin chain.*
7. *During the changing of anisotropy, the forward total ﬂux is larger than the backward one at ﬁrst, and then reverses, although the heat contribution from ground state in the backward transport is always larger than that in the forward one.*
8. *It has been shown that rectiﬁcation can change sign when the magnetic ﬁeld, temperature, the anisotropy, and th system size change.*
