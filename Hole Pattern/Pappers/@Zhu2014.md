abstract: Active heat flow control is essential for broad applications of heating, cooling, and energy conversion. Like electronic devices developed for the control of electric power, it is very desirable to develop advanced all-thermal solid-state devices that actively control heat flow without consuming other forms of energy. Here we demonstrate temperature-gated thermal rectification using vanadium dioxide beams in which the environmental temperature actively modulates asymmetric heat flow. In this three terminal device, there are two switchable states, which can be regulated by global heating. In the “Rectifier” state, we observe up to 28% thermal rectification. In the “Resistor” state, the thermal rectification is significantly suppressed (<1%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of solid-state active-thermal devices with a large rectification in the Rectifier state. This temperature-gated rectifier can have substantial implications ranging from autonomous thermal management of heating and cooling systems to efficient thermal energy conversion and storage.

# Annotations:
1. Active heat flow control is essential for broad applications of heating, cooling, and energy conversion. Like electronic devices developed for the control of electric power, it is very desirable to develop advanced all-thermal solid-state devices that actively control heat flow without consuming other forms of energy.
2. We demonstrate temperature-gated thermal rectification using vanadium dioxide beams in which the environmental temperature actively modulates asymmetric heat flow. Thermal rectifications in the beams can be actively switched on and off by changing the device temperature, which control the metallic and insulating phases, thus function as a thermal gate.

4. Max. rectification (%28) is observed below 340K when mixed metallic and insulating phases coexist in the VO2 beam. Once the device are heated above 340K and they become completely metallic, they behave as ordinary thermal resistors, where thermal rectification is switched off (<%1) ![[Pasted image 20220830103813.png]]
