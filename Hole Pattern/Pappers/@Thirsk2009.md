# Annotations:
1. *Spacecraft in low orbit of the earth travel at Mach 25, or about 8 km per second. These spacecraft orbit the earth once every 90 minutes.*
2. *Much greater extremes occur outside the spacecraft. When on the sun-lit side of the earth, the temperature on the spacecraft or space station can reach over 100°C. Forty-five minutes later, during a night pass through earth’s dark shadow, temperatures can plunge to –100°C.*
